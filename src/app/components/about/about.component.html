            Hi, I’m <em>Het Shah</em>, a <strong>passionate programmer</strong> with a deep love for computers since
            childhood.
            My coding journey began in <strong>6th grade</strong>, sparked by a simple yet profound question:
            <em>“How does this work?”</em> while exploring a webpage with my tutor. That moment ignited my curiosity
            about the <em>inner workings of technology</em> and fueled my desire to delve into the field of
            <strong>computer engineering</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            What sets me apart is my <strong>insatiable curiosity</strong> and drive to understand systems deeply. I
            don’t just learn
            <em>what works</em> but strive to uncover <em>how and why</em> it works. I enjoy writing <strong>clean,
                optimized code</strong>
            and continuously exploring the <em>mechanics</em> behind every topic I study.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond coding, I’ve been playing guitar for <strong>two years</strong> and have a <em>deep appreciation
                for
                music</em>.
            I’m constantly learning and growing as a musician and even have my own
